\section{Lecture 1}
\label{sec:lecture1}

Today, we reviewed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Homology.
\item How to construct cohomology.
\item Made a statement about a sequence splitting.
\item The sequence contains $\ker \delta_n$, which we don't understand.
\end{enumerate}

Understanding this $\ker \delta_n$ will be the topic of the next lecture. For more details, see my handwritten notes.
